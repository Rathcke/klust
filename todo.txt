  * Work on report often and early.
    Rasmus recommends dedicating a month to writing.

  * Refer to our GitHub repository somewhere in our report.

  * Argue for likely correctness of our algorithm (and implementation) by
    testing on a synthetic data set and on real data:

      - Synthetic data set where we know the number of clusters that should be
        returned from the algorithm. E.g. generate k random (non-alike)
        sequences, make a number of permutations of these k sequences and the
        resulting clustering should yield k clusters.

      - Real data where we e.g. do multidimensional scaling and color code /
        highlight centroids and the sequences belonging to each centroid. Then
        centroids should not be close together (maybe they can be in multi.
        dim. scaling?) and we better get the clusters that are apparent from
        the visualization.

  * Order centroids by unique word count and stop search after a specific
    number of rejects. This idea might still be interesting with out current
    bitset kmer occurrence algorithm.
