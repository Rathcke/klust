Edit distance
=============

Levenshtein distance
--------------------

  * The Levenshtein distance between two string is the number of insertions,
    deletions or substitution required to change one string into the other.


Hierarchical clustering
=======================

  * Agglomerative / bottom-up approach: each string starts in its own cluster
    and pairs of clusters are merged as one one moves up the hierarchy.

    Complexity: O(n^3), special case: O(n^2)

  * Divisive / top-down: all strings start in one cluster and splits are
    performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.

    Complexity: O(2^n)


Sequence alignment
==================

Aligning 2 sequences (pairwise alignment), or 3 or more sequences (multiple
sequence alignment), by inserting gaps to align similar characters in
successive columns.

A different goal/method than clustering, but might be useful for discovering
similarities in strings, that e.g. Levenshtein can't discover.


Other concepts to look into
===========================

  * Clustal W (multiple sequencd alignment)

  * k-means clustering

  * mixture of gaussians

  * gauss mixture model
