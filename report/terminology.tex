\section{Terminology}
This section describes some basic terminology and notation of this text.

The words \emph{sequence} and \emph{string} will be used to denote the same
concepts, i.e. a possibly infinite, ordered list of objects, where an object
will most often be a text character.

In this text, the notion of a subsequence is different from that of a
substring: a substring $S'$ of a sequence $S$ is a consecutive, ordered list of
objects, that occurs in $S$, while a subsequence $S''$ of $S$ is a sequence
that can be obtained from $S$ by deleting some objects from the sequence
without changing the order of the objects.

\subsection{Notation}
Let $s$ and $t$ be sequences.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $|s|$ denotes the length of $s$
  \item $s \sqsubseteq t$ denotes that $s$ is a substring of $t$
  \item $J(A,B)$ denotes the Jaccard index, or Jaccard similarity coefficient,
    of sets $A$ and $B$
\end{itemize}
