\section{Introduction}
Clustering is the task of grouping objects so that, based on a given similarity
threshold, each object belongs to only one cluster. Our clustering method strive to find a centroid, which is a sequence that represents a cluster, that has a similarity above the threshold to a given object, but the centroid is not guaranteed to be the best matching centroid.

The main motivation for this project comes from a need for efficient tools for
clustering of sequence data, and related techniques, in the microbiology
department at the University of Copenhagen. In particular, the idea for this
project comes from a collaboration between the supervisor of this project,
Rasmus Fonseca, and Martin Asser Hansen, who is a bioinformatician in the
Molecular Microbial Ecology
Group\footnote{\url{http://www2.bio.ku.dk/microbiology/}}.

Clustering huge amounts of DNA/RNA-sequences (up to 500
million strings of 500-1500 characters each) is computationally hard and there are not many available algorithms and tools for efficient clustering of
sequencing data. The one tool
\texttt{UCLUST}\footnote{\url{http://drive5.com/usearch/}} that does the job is
closed-source and considered too expensive.

The goal of this project is to research the possibilities of creating an open source tool that can match the performance of the proprietary version of
\texttt{UCLUST}.
